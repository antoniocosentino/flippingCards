Flipping Cards is an iOS/Android app that allows you to learn German words faster by creating flashcards with your own selection of words.

Just add words to your wallet and then you can train your knowledge by organizing these words in cards decks.
The app doesn't require an Internet connection, since the words are stored in the internal dictionary. Adding a new word to your wallet takes just a few seconds and you will be in full control of what to learn.
